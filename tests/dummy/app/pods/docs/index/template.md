# What is Ember Phaser?

This addon makes it easier for you to inject the Phaser3 game framework into your Ember application.

Making amazing cross-platform games is now easier than itâ€™s ever been thanks to Phaser, an Open Source JavaScript game development library developed by Richard Davey and his team at Photonstorm. Games developed with Phaser can be played on any (modern) web browser, and can also be turned into native phone apps.
